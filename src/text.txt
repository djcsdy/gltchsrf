variation under domestication 
causes of variability effects of habit and the use or disuse of 
parts correlated variation inheritance character of domestic 
varieties difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and 
species origin of domestic varieties from one or more species domestic 
pigeons their differences and origin principles of selection 
anciently followed their effects methodical and unconscious 
selection unknown origin of our domestic productions circumstances 
favourable to mans power of selection 
variation under nature 
variability individual differences doubtful species wide ranging 
much diffused and common species vary most species of the larger 
genera in each country vary more frequently than the species of the 
smaller genera many of the species of the larger genera resemble 
varieties in being very closely but unequally related to each other 
and in having restricted ranges 
struggle for existence 
its bearing on natural selection the term used in a wide 
sense geometrical ratio of increase rapid increase of naturalised 
animals and plants nature of the checks to increase competition 
universal effects of climate protection from the number of 
individuals complex relations of all animals and plants throughout 
nature struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties 
of the same species often severe between species of the same genus the 
relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations 
natural selection or the survival of the fittest 
natural selection its power compared with mans selection its power 
on characters of trifling importance its power at all ages and on 
both sexes sexual selection on the generality of intercrosses 
between individuals of the same species circumstances favourable and 
unfavourable to the results of natural selection namely intercrossing 
isolation number of individuals slow action extinction caused by 
natural selection divergence of character related to the diversity of 
inhabitants of any small area and to naturalisation action of natural 
selection through divergence of character and extinction on the 
descendants from a common parent explains the grouping of all organic 
beings advance in organisation low forms preserved convergence of 
character indefinite multiplication of species summary 
laws of variation 
effects of changed conditions use and disuse combined with natural 
selection organs of flight and of vision acclimatisation correlated 
variation compensation and economy of growth false 
correlations multiple rudimentary and lowly organised structures 
variable parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable 
specific characters more variable than generic secondary sexual 
characters variable species of the same genus vary in an analogous 
manner reversions to longlost characters summary 
difficulties of the theory 
difficulties of the theory of descent with modification absence 
or rarity of transitional varieties transitions in habits of 
life diversified habits in the same species species with habits 
widely different from those of their allies organs of extreme 
perfection modes of transition cases of difficulty natura non facit 
saltum organs of small importance organs not in all cases absolutely 
perfect the law of unity of type and of the conditions of existence 
embraced by the theory of natural selection 
miscellaneous objections to the theory of natural selection 
longevity modifications not necessarily simultaneous modifications 
apparently of no direct service progressive development characters of 
small functional importance the most constant supposed incompetence 
of natural selection to account for the incipient stages of useful 
structures causes which interfere with the acquisition through natural 
selection of useful structures gradations of structure with changed 
functions widely different organs in members of the same class 
developed from one and the same source reasons for disbelieving in 
great and abrupt modifications 
instinct 
instincts comparable with habits but different in their 
origin instincts graduated aphides and ants instincts 
variable domestic instincts their origin natural instincts of 
the cuckoo molothrus ostrich and parasitic bees slavemaking 
ants hivebee its cellmaking instinct changes of instinct and 
structure not necessarily simultaneous difficulties on the theory of 
the natural selection of instincts neuter or sterile insects summary 
hybridism 
distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of 
hybrids sterility various in degree not universal affected by close 
interbreeding removed by domestication laws governing the sterility 
of hybrids sterility not a special endowment but incidental on 
other differences not accumulated by natural selection causes of 
the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids parallelism between the 
effects of changed conditions of life and of crossing dimorphism and 
trimorphism fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel 
offspring not universal hybrids and mongrels compared independently of 
their fertility summary 
on the imperfection of the geological record 
on the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day on the 
nature of extinct intermediate varieties on their number on the lapse 
of time as inferred from the rate of denudation and of deposition on 
the lapse of time as estimated in years on the poorness of our 
palaeontological collections on the intermittence of geological 
formations on the denudation of granitic areas on the absence of 
intermediate varieties in any one formation on the sudden appearance 
of groups of species on their sudden appearance in the lowest known 
fossiliferous strata antiquity of the habitable earth 
on the geological succession of organic beings 
on the slow and successive appearance of new species on their different 
rates of change species once lost do not reappear groups of species 
follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as 
do single species on extinction on simultaneous changes in the forms 
of life throughout the world on the affinities of extinct species to 
each other and to living species on the state of development of 
ancient forms on the succession of the same types within the same 
areas
geographical distribution 
present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical 
conditions importance of barriers affinity of the productions of the 
same continent centres of creation means of dispersal by changes of 
climate and of the level of the land and by occasional means dispersal 
during the glacial period alternate glacial periods in the north and 
south 
geographical distribution continued 
distribution of freshwater productions on the inhabitants of oceanic 
islands absence of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals on 
the relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest 
mainland on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent 
modification
mutual affinities of organic beings morphology embryology rudimentary 
organs 
classification groups subordinate to groups natural system rules and 
difficulties in classification explained on the theory of descent 
with modification classification of varieties descent always used in 
classification analogical or adaptive characters affinities 
general complex and radiating extinction separates and defines 
groups morphology between members of the same class between parts of 
the same individual embryology laws of explained by variations not 
supervening at an early age and being inherited at a corresponding 
age rudimentary organs their origin explained summary 
recapitulation and conclusion 
recapitulation of the objections to the theory of natural 
selection recapitulation of the general and special circumstances 
in its favour causes of the general belief in the immutability 
of species how far the theory of natural selection may be 
extended effects of its adoption on the study of natural 
history concluding remarks
